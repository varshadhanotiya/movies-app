## How it Works

This app utilizes the following technologies and concepts:

*   **react-router-dom:**  For navigation and routing between different pages.

The app is structured with three main routes:

*   `/` â†’ Home (Displays popular movies)
*   `/explore` â†’ Explore (Browse more movies)
*   `/movie/:movieId` â†’ Movie Details (Shows detailed information for a specific movie, where `:movieId` is a dynamic parameter representing the movie's ID)

## Running the App

1.  **Install dependencies:**

2.  **Start the app:**

    ```bash

    ```

3.  **Open in browser:**
